Whats up guys? Are we playing catch 22 here?

# Experience n°2

I've been running

    LANG=C TMPDIR=/mnt/1/tmp TMP=/mnt/1/tmp git-repair --force

on a BUP repository for more than a wekk.  The output so far looks like:

    Initialized empty Git repository in /mnt/1/tmp/tmprepo8ymhUQ/.git/
    fatal: /mnt/1/monnier-broken.bup: '/mnt/1/monnier-broken.bup' is outside repository at '/mnt/1/monnier-broken.bup'
    Initialized empty Git repository in /mnt/1/tmp/tmprepoz8b3XR/.git/
    fatal: /mnt/1/monnier-broken.bup: '/mnt/1/monnier-broken.bup' is outside repository at '/mnt/1/monnier-broken.bup'
    [...]

where those two lines repeat every few hours.  Should I assume it's stuck in some kind of inf-loop, or will it actually end at some point?
