My experience with git repair:

git repair
Running git fsck ...
Stack space overflow: current size 8388608 bytes.
Use `+RTS -Ksize -RTS' to increase it.

git repair +RTS -K32M -RTS
git-repair: Most RTS options are disabled. Link with -rtsopts to enable them.

Whats up guys? Are we playing catch 22 here?
