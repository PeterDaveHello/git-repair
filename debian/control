Description: repair various forms of damage to git repositories
 git-repair can repair various forms of damage to git repositories.
 .
 It is a complement to git fsck, which finds problems, but does not fix them.
 .
 As well as avoiding the need to rm -rf a damaged repository and re-clone,
 using git-repair can help rescue commits you've made to the damaged
 repository and not yet pushed out.
