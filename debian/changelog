git-repair (1.20131119) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added test-runner, which can be used to randomly corrupt test 
    repositories, in reproducible ways, which allows easy
    corruption-driven-development.
  * Improve repair code in the case where the index file is corrupt,
    and this hides other problems.
