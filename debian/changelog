git-repair (1.20131119) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added test-runner, which can be used to randomly corrupt test 
    repositories, in reproducible ways, which allows easy
    corruption-driven-development.
  * Improve repair code in the case where the index file is corrupt,
    and this hides other problems.
  * Write a dummy .git/HEAD if the file is missing or corrupt, as
    git otherwise will not treat the repository as a git repo.
  * Improve fsck code to find badly corrupted objects that crash git fsck
    before it can complain about them.
  * Fixed crashes on bad file encodings.
  * Can now run 1000 tests (./test-runner . --stop-on-failure -n 1000 --force)
    with 0 failures.
