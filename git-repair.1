git\-repair \- Fix a broken git repository
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
git\-repair [\-\-force]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This can fix a corrupt or broken git repository, which git fsck would
only complain has problems.
.PP
It does by deleting all corrupt objects, and retreiving all missing
objects that it can from the remotes of the repository.
.PP
If that is not sufficient to fully recover the repository, it can also
reset branches back to commits before the corruption happened, delete
branches that are no longer available due to the lost data, and remove any
missing files from the index. It will only do this if run with the
\fB\-\-force\fP option, since that rewrites history and throws out missing data.
Note that the \fB\-\-force\fP option never touches tags, even if they are no
longer usable due to missing data.
.PP
After running this command, you will probably want to run \fBgit fsck\fP to
verify it fixed the repository. Note that fsck may still complain about
objects referenced by the reflog, or the stash, if they were unable to be
recovered. This command does not try to clean up either the reflog or the
stash.
.PP
Since this command unpacks all packs in the repository, you may want to
run \fBgit gc\fP afterwards.
